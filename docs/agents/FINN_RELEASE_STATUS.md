# FINN Release Status

Status: canonical

Runtime identity comes from Git and public deployment surfaces, not this document's own commit SHA.

## Active Release

| Field | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Phase | `READY_FOR_INDEPENDENT_QA`. Build gates and production identity checks passed; independent QA has not assessed this repair. |
| Goal | Repair stale and incomplete indicator-score presentation, preserve missing values in FINN evidence, and allow unscored market indicator configuration while history accumulates. |
| Candidate branch | Merged to `main` in `e7addf5459b08d39509726e21e6334624ddcefb8`. |
| Candidate implementation SHA | `d3c764cdcfa9bc2d804e5b0967c2398b13df714e` |
| PR | [#87](https://github.com/gvangalen/antigravity-trading-tool/pull/87), merged. |
| Previous live SHA | `3b2664f89b37b13fdde8d127bf1350a2c070138b`, independently tested and not accepted. |
| Production SHA | `e7addf5459b08d39509726e21e6334624ddcefb8` observed on both public surfaces after Auto Deploy. This status-only update creates a later SHA; QA must bind to the current public backend/frontend SHA. |

The new Build batch keeps a raw indicator reading separate from a validated score. Analyse day cards and row explanations use the canonical daily score and its indicator evidence. FINN preserves missing macro and technical scores as `null` and exposes the original source timestamp. A market indicator with too little dated history can be configured but remains unscored. The config dialog now explains duplicate-indicator failures inline. These fixes do not create the missing five-observation production fixture or prove a positive match or paper execution.

Measured local evidence: root pytest **3145 passed, 3 skipped**, `.local-finn-parity-artifacts/indicator-score-v2-qa-fix-pytest.log` SHA-256 `ecd9df3e79c791764637f1be6f32a7c677204840503a751006cb51ce56f88a03`; frontend production build and typecheck passed, `.local-finn-parity-artifacts/indicator-score-v2-qa-fix-frontend-build.log` SHA-256 `0853c8d97c722f652189763c03c7c6fdade2bca2d238f1b53c06cdd7904799d3`; frontend i18n, commands, proposals and high-severity production audit passed with zero vulnerabilities. The new canonical-score presentation tests passed **2/2**. Isolated prefork Celery/Responses safe-action matrix passed **16/16**, zero prohibited executions, `.local-finn-parity-artifacts/indicator-score-v2-qa-fix-full-action-matrix.json` SHA-256 `a8168eb0a1a93d52f1cb7e5a457a22e544d3d40358f8e93cdcd073d222aff19d`. Real-provider selector development passed **18/18**, SHA-256 `c61e11db46079b72471e615c4bac81dbcaac36bc4bcd4ec1d81873c8c003f747`; regression passed **109/109**, SHA-256 `bf414d7cdc37fceb4be4870abdbe09495221dc8fc5ae9337a7475d2d5783393a`, with zero provider, schema, parse, validation or timeout failures. Their artifacts share the `indicator-score-v2-qa-fix-selector-` prefix in `.local-finn-parity-artifacts/`.

[Candidate CI](https://github.com/gvangalen/antigravity-trading-tool/actions/runs/37506880820) and [main CI](https://github.com/gvangalen/antigravity-trading-tool/actions/runs/37507227211) completed success. [Auto Deploy](https://github.com/gvangalen/antigravity-trading-tool/actions/runs/37507564081) completed success for `e7addf5459b08d39509726e21e6334624ddcefb8`; public backend health and frontend build-info both returned HTTP 200 and that SHA on 2026-10-06. Build has not run authenticated live QA. The next QA pass must check AAPL stale DXY and one-observation Price presentation, FINN's S&P 500 missing-score semantics, duplicate and insufficient-history indicator configuration, and a controlled positive setupmatch/paper decision only when five genuinely dated measurements per required source are available.

The score-flow code passed local root pytest (3142 passed, 3 skipped), frontend build, mobile typecheck/lint/web smoke and migration plan validation. The frontend export was rebuilt, and the production dependency audit passed with zero vulnerabilities after updating the `sharp` override. [Candidate CI](https://github.com/gvangalen/antigravity-trading-tool/actions/runs/37498674203) and [main CI](https://github.com/gvangalen/antigravity-trading-tool/actions/runs/37499125577) completed success. [Auto Deploy](https://github.com/gvangalen/antigravity-trading-tool/actions/runs/37499391196) completed success for `56e8a255ad34b74391ec0ae28724e4eb55ddaf95`; public backend health and frontend build-info both returned HTTP 200 and that SHA on 2026-10-06.

The isolated local PostgreSQL/Redis/FastAPI/prefork Celery stack used the real Responses provider and synthetic fixture users. The worker-driven safe-action matrix passed **16/16** with zero prohibited executions: `.local-finn-parity-artifacts/indicator-score-flow-v2-full-action-matrix.json`, SHA-256 `10c048fd645a6ac49ed701f6c88b8c0a950a87bad1e0d604e3e6d0de15071d96`. Real-provider selector development passed **18/18**: `.local-finn-parity-artifacts/indicator-score-flow-v2-selector-development.json`, SHA-256 `eb416a8e6a45cb67854e4c7a425cdc497376162c65d91ac48179f2edb4ddc170`. Real-provider selector regression passed **109/109**: `.local-finn-parity-artifacts/indicator-score-flow-v2-selector-regression.json`, SHA-256 `63f984a2a1c9e045db9fa59da9cde06018ca85f4c9f476500a98ac44dc939728`. Both selector runs had zero provider, schema, parse, validation and timeout failures. The isolated migration completed successfully. Independent authenticated live QA later tested production SHA `3b2664f89b37b13fdde8d127bf1350a2c070138b` and did not accept the score flow because of stale partial scores, missing-to-zero FINN evidence and configuration errors.

| Previous live SHA | `82f8b6bec76b80234e4a8b1222aa96fb9cd5cc3b`, reported by independent live QA as not accepted. |
| Production SHA | `1f50e2f3adc682de0bf2f468be7aaddbc89e4561` observed on both public surfaces after Auto Deploy. This status-only update creates a later SHA; QA must bind to the current public backend/frontend SHA. |

## Change And Limits

- FINN reads the same owner-scoped saved daily market score as Analyse. It receives source status separately and does not treat a reported score as a verified complete benchmark.
- Saved setup score boundaries remain readable without choosing among linked strategies. The setup-match tool carries those conditions even when current scores are incomplete.
- Smart-DCA score bands and hypothetical amounts are derived from the execution curve engine. Exact score 70 selects the high band in a 40/70 step curve.
- The paper-bot card displays a missing stop-loss instead of `€ NaN`.
- A dated score report can be read even when it precedes today; its report date does not establish current source freshness.
- The [live test plan](../operations/setup-market-match-live-test-plan.md) includes the QA regressions. The one generic failure turn has no runtrace, so its exact cause is not established. A positive match, paper-bot decision with fresh sources, and authenticated cross-surface behavior remain for independent QA.

## Measured Local Build Evidence

All runtime artifacts below used an isolated local PostgreSQL, Redis, FastAPI and prefork Celery stack with the real Responses provider. The chat model was `gpt-6-luna` with reasoning `none`. The selector used its separately configured provider model. The local matrix made no broker orders, live bot activations, live trading calls or production connections.

| Frontend | Build, typecheck, i18n lint/tests, commands, proposals, setup tests and high-severity production dependency audit passed; zero vulnerabilities. | `.local-finn-parity-artifacts/setup-match-qa-fix-frontend-build.log`, SHA-256 `7adc82013f7addf1e524a5f4cba3ae91b7da2aa70c0a0ca4bf72a4e062744d6f`. |

An additional 37-case public parity runner was tried and did not pass. Its old DCA setup prompt lacks the now-required amount, so clarification is correct, while its read probes require legacy operation IDs absent from the current model-led chat route. This runner is not the required 16-action contract gate; its mismatch is recorded rather than counted as green.
